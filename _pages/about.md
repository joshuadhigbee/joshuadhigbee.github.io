I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the University of Chicago.  My research interests are in industrial organization, quantitative marketing, and econometrics.  Before coming to Chicago, I did my undergraduate degree in economics and mathematics at Brigham Young University, where I worked as a research assistant on topics related to statistics and environmental epidemiology.  

My job market paper (coming soon) studies the role of information provision in the design of two-sided auction markets.
I am also currently working on projects related to demand for information on financial exchanges, identification of agent beliefs in learning models, search and learning across online platforms, and bargaining in mergers and acquisitions contracts.

I am on the 2024-2025 job market.
