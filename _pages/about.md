![Me]("/images/Me%20cropped.png")

I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the University of Chicago.  My research interests are in industrial organization, quantitative marketing, and econometrics. 

My job market paper (coming soon) studies the role of information provision in the design of two-sided auction markets.
More broadly, my research is on platforms and the role that information plays in how they function.
I am currently working on projects related to demand for market data on financial exchanges, search and learning across online platforms, identification of agent beliefs in learning models, and bargaining in mergers and acquisitions contracts.

<b>I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.</b>
