I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the University of Chicago.  My research interests are in industrial organization and econometrics.  Before coming to Chicago, I did my undergraduate degree in economics and mathematics at Brigham Young University, where I worked as a research assistant on topics related to statistics and environmental epidemiology.  

I am currently working on projects related to learning and information design in online auctions, identification of agent beliefs in learning models, and empirical bargaining in mergers and acquisitions contracts.
