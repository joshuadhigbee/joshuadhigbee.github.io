I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at The Ohio State University. I obtained my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Chicago in 2025.

My research is in empirical industrial organization, with some overlap in quantitative marketing and econometrics.
In particular, my focus is on platforms and the role that information plays in how they function.
I am currently working on projects related to learning and mechanism design on auction platforms, financial exchanges, online retail, and position auctions, as well as studying corporate contracting and the identification of structural learning models.
