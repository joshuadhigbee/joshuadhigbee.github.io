I am a Ph.D. student in economics at the University of Chicago.  Before coming to Chicago, I did my undergraduate degree in economics and mathematics at Brigham Young University, where I worked as a research assistant working on topics related to statistics and environmental epidemiology.  My research interests are in industrial organization and econometrics.  

I am currently working on projects related to productivity and learning in online auctions and hosptial performance, cost and conduct assumptions in merger simulations, and demand estimation.
