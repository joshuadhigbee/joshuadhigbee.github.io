Using national regulatory data and estimated fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations at the county level, we exploit exogenous variation in PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure induced by the PM<sub>2.5</sub> National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) within an instrumental variables model to measure the effect of pollution on non-accidental mortality rates.  We find that a 10 &mu;g/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> leads to 11.4% and 13.1% increases in adult and senior mortality rates, respectively.  Furthermore, we use event study specifications and difference-in-differences models and find that the PM<sub>2.5</sub> NAAQS led to significant reductions in PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations within regulated counties, along with some evidence for significant reductions in county-level mortality rates as a result of regulation in the decade following the implementation of the standards.  We estimate that the implementation of the 1997 PM<sub>2.5</sub> NAAQS led to an approximate reduction of 1% in non-accidental adult mortality rates among treated counties in the period from 2005-2015, and counterfactual analysis suggests large potential benefits from further lowering the regulatory threshold.
