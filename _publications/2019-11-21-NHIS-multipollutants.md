BACKGROUND: Cohort studies have documented associations between fine particulate matter air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and mortality risk. However, there remains uncertainty regarding the contribution of co-pollutants and the stability of pollution-mortality associations in models that include 
multiple air pollutants. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality relationship varies spatially, when exposures are decomposed according to scale of spatial variability, or temporally, when effect estimates are allowed to change between years.

METHODS: A cohort of 635,539 individuals was compiled using public National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 1987 to 2014 and linked with mortality follow-up through 2015. Modelled air pollution exposure estimates for PM<sub>2.5</sub>, other criteria air pollutants, and spatial decompositions (< 1 km, 1–10 km, 10–100 km, > 100 km) of PM<sub>2.5</sub> were assigned at the census-tract level. The NHIS samples were also divided into yearly cohorts for temporally-decomposed analyses. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in regression models that included up to six criteria pollutants; four spatial decompositions of PM<sub>2.5</sub>; and two- and five-year lagged mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposures in the temporally-decomposed cohorts. Meta-analytic fixed-effect estimates were calculated using results from temporally-decomposed analyses and compared with time-independent results using 17- and 28-year exposure windows.

RESULTS: In multiple-pollutant analyses, PM<sub>2.5</sub> demonstrated the most robust pollutant-mortality association. Coarse fraction particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) were also associated with excess mortality risk. The PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality association was observed across all four spatial scales of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, with higher but less precisely estimated HRs observed for local (< 1 km) and neighborhood (1–10 km) variations. In temporally-decomposed analyses, the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality HRs were stable across yearly cohorts. The meta-analytic HR using two-year lagged PM<sub>2.5</sub> equaled 1.10 (95% CI 1.07, 1.13) per 10 &mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>. Comparable results were observed in time-independent analyses using a 17-year (HR 1.13, CI 1.09, 1.16) or 28-year (HR 1.09, CI 1.07, 1.12) exposure window.

CONCLUSIONS: Long-term exposures to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>2.5-10</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> were associated with increased risk of all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality. Each spatial decomposition of PM<sub>2.5</sub> was associated with mortality risk, and PM<sub>2.5</sub>-mortality associations were consistent over time.
